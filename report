## Introduction

This case study explores data from **Bellabeat**, a high-tech company focused on women's health and wellness. This project analyzes user activity, sleep, and heart rate data from April and May 2016 to uncover actionable insights that can enhance Bellabeat’s product offerings. Bellabeat can tailor features and recommendations to optimize user wellness by understanding how activity correlates with sleep and heart health.

## Data Sources

The data used for this analysis comes from Fitbit's publically available dataset on Kaggle. This data contains two separate folders: one for the month of

Data includes:
- **Activity Data**: Daily step counts, active minutes, and calories burned.
- **Sleep Data**: Total sleep duration, including minutes asleep, restless, and awake.
- **Heart Rate Data**: Daily average heart rate measurements.

The data was processed and cleaned using **SQL** within Google BigQuery, and visualized using **Google Sheets**.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this case study are:
- To analyze the relationship between user activity (steps) and sleep.
- To explore how heart rate is affected by both activity and sleep patterns.
- To identify high-activity users and assess their recovery (sleep and heart rate).
- To generate actionable insights that Bellabeat can use to improve product features and user engagement.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned to handle `NULL` values, incorrect or missing entries, and ensure accurate calculations of metrics such as **TotalSleepHrs**, **AvgDailyHeartRate**, and **AvgDailySteps**.

The key steps in the data cleaning process include:
- Aggregating daily data for each user.
- Removing records with incomplete sleep or heart rate data where necessary.
- Normalizing and scaling the data for visualizations.

### 2. SQL Queries
We ran SQL queries to explore key relationships in the data, such as:
- The correlation between steps and sleep duration.
- The effect of high activity on heart rate.
- The connection between sleep quality and recovery (via heart rate).

For the detailed SQL queries used in this analysis, please refer to the [analysis folder](../analysis/data_cleaning.sql).

## Key Findings

### Activity vs. Sleep

![Steps vs. Sleep](../visualizations/steps_vs_sleep.png)

- **Observation**: Users with high daily steps, such as user `4388161847` (11,198 steps), exhibit varying levels of sleep. Some users are highly active but do not get adequate sleep, such as user `7007744171` (65 minutes of sleep).
- **Insight**: There is no clear correlation between higher steps and increased sleep. This suggests that highly active users may need reminders to balance activity with recovery.
  
### Activity vs. Heart Rate

![Steps vs. Heart Rate](../visualizations/steps_vs_heart_rate.png)

- **Observation**: Users with higher daily steps generally have lower heart rates, suggesting improved cardiovascular health. For example, users like `5553957443` (8,569 steps, 67.85 bpm) show signs of better fitness compared to less active users.
- **Insight**: Regular physical activity is linked to better heart health, but users may not be aware of how their fitness is improving over time.

### Sleep Quality and Heart Rate

![Sleep vs. Heart Rate](../visualizations/sleep_vs_heart_rate.png)

- **Observation**: Users who get more sleep tend to have lower heart rates. For instance, user `5577150313` (417 minutes of sleep, 67.63 bpm) shows better recovery compared to users who sleep less.
- **Insight**: More sleep correlates with improved recovery, as reflected in lower heart rates. This suggests that Bellabeat should emphasize the importance of sleep in overall wellness.

### High-Activity Users

![High-Activity Users](../visualizations/high_activity_users.png)

- **Observation**: High-activity users (over 10,000 steps) show varying sleep and heart rate patterns. User `4388161847` logs high steps and gets a decent amount of sleep, while user `7007744171` logs similar steps but gets very little sleep.
- **Insight**: Even highly active users may not be recovering properly. Bellabeat should help users find a balance between activity and rest for optimal health.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are the key recommendations for Bellabeat:

1. **Promote Recovery Features**: Users who are highly active often don't get enough sleep. Bellabeat should develop features that encourage recovery by suggesting rest days or providing **sleep optimization tips**.
   
2. **Track Heart Health Improvements**: Introduce features that allow users to track **heart rate improvements** over time, showing them how their fitness levels are improving with regular activity.

3. **Personalized Notifications**: Create personalized wellness notifications that highlight when users need more sleep or recovery time, especially for users with high activity and low sleep data.

4. **Segmented User Insights**: Offer **customized insights** based on user segments, such as “high-activity/low-sleep” users, and provide tailored recommendations that focus on their specific health needs.

---

## Conclusion

This case study provided insights into the relationship between user activity, sleep, and heart rate. The data suggests that while many users are active, they may not be optimizing their recovery, as reflected in inconsistent sleep and heart rate patterns. Bellabeat has the opportunity to enhance its product by focusing on **recovery, heart health tracking,** and **personalized recommendations**, which will provide greater value to users aiming to improve their overall wellness.
